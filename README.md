## About The Project

[\* This was an academic project]

Nowadays, we can buy a used car through many channels, such as trading with friends, buying from automobile dealers, searching and trading on Craigslist, etc. However, how people negotiate used car prices or what factors determine used car prices? How to know whether the deal you received is good or bad?

To answer those questions, by using used car trading information from Craigslist, we aim to build models that help us to and the factors affect used car price and help us to determine whether a quote is a good or bad deal. In the end, everyone who interested in purchasing used vehicle or companies deal with used vehicle business would be benefit from this project.
